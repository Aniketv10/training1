<p><span style="color: darkblue;">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</span> (/ˈəbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) 
    was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied 
    physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <span style="color: blue;">Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</span>
     and <span style="color: blue;">Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</span> and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be 
     known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
      nuclear tests in <span style="color: blue;">1998</span>, the first since the original nuclear test by India in <span style="color: blue;">1974.</span></p>
